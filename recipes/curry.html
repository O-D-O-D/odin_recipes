    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>

        This is the perfect weeknight curry â€” it's primarily comprised of ingredients you probably already have on hand: chicken, onions, garlic, spices, double cream, and tinned tomatoes. Not a spice lover? All good; while there are a lot of warm-ground spices that season the dish, this curry isn't spicy at all. 

        <h4>Wait, shouldn't there be curry powder in this curry?      </h4>
        Curry powder is simply a combination of various ground spices, which are present in this recipe! This combination of spices will yield that familiar curry flavor, and it's on the milder side. If you're looking to kick up the heat, try stirring in some cayenne a little at a time.
        
        <h4>What condiments should I serve with this?</h4>
        Mango chutneys or lime pickle are great accompaniments for curry. Their uses go way beyond curry, so you won't have any problem getting to the bottom of the jar.
        
        <h4>How long will the leftovers last?</h4>
        Kept in an airtight container, this curry can last up to 4 days.
